# Placement Preparation Repository

Welcome to my Placement Preparation Repository! This repository contains my daily practice code and documentation for Core Java and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I am committed to consistently improving my skills and knowledge in these areas to excel in placement interviews. This README file serves as a guide to understand the structure and purpose of this repository.

## About

This repository is dedicated to my daily practice sessions for placement preparation. It serves as a record of my progress, where I commit my code and documentation regularly. Through this repository, I aim to demonstrate my commitment, growth, and understanding of core Java concepts and DSA.

## Core Java

In the **Core Java** section, you will find code examples and documentation related to the fundamental concepts of Java programming language. This includes topics such as:

- Variables and data types
- Control flow statements
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts
- Exception handling
- Input/output operations
- Collections framework
- Multi-threading
- And more...

Each concept is organized into separate directories with descriptive names. Within each directory, you will find code files (*.java) and corresponding documentation files (*.md) explaining the concept and providing examples. The documentation files also include explanations of the code logic and any key points to remember.

Feel free to explore the Core Java section to get a better understanding of my proficiency in Java programming.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

The **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** section contains code implementations, explanations, and analysis of various data structures and algorithms. This section covers important topics including:

- Arrays and strings
- Linked lists
- Stacks and queues
- Trees and graphs
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Dynamic programming
- Graph algorithms
- And more...

Similar to the Core Java section, each DSA topic has its own directory with relevant code files (*.java) and documentation files (*.md). The documentation files provide explanations of the concept, algorithmic complexity analysis, and example use cases.

Feel free to explore the DSA section to gain insights into my problem-solving skills and understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as my personal practice record, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and improvements. If you spot any issues, have ideas for code optimization, or want to suggest additional concepts to cover, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can enhance the repository and make it even more valuable.
